** Time how long to execute **

-------- Method 1: --------

function()  {
var start = new Date()

//code for algorithm goes here

var end = new Date() - start
console.log(end)
}

the problem with this is that its asynchronous. while it creates a new Date object, it also runs the next bit of code. THerefore this method isn't that effective when dealing with miniscual timings

-------- Method 2: --------

function()  {
    //stuff
}
console.time('some string' + someVariable + 'some string continued')
function()
console.timeEnd('some string' + someVariable + 'some string continued')


this is much more accurate in the time it takes to execute function
